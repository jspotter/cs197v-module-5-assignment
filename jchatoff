Hello, my nanme is Jenna. 
Outside of class, I currently work in the lab for a biotech company that does genetic testing. 
The company is located in Potrero Hill. In my free time, I play soccer in a coed adult league and also enjoy spending time with friends and exploring the city. 
This is my second semester at CCSF.
