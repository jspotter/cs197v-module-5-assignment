Hello, my name is Erik Heckman.

I am general building contractor, but a recent medical condition has rendered me unable to practice.

My passions include yoga, urban cycling, whaleboat-rowing (go Iron Oars!), cryptic crosswords, CBC radio, and entertaining cats--although I haven't partaken in the first three for quite a while.
