My name is Mundy Reimer!  My interests range
in everything from physics and math, to 
philosophy and languages.  I am particularly
interested in the origin of life, the 
structure of consciousness, and the general
phenomenon of self-organization and emergent
properties.  My favorite hobbies are reading
about and doing math.  I also like to play
badminton.
