I teach LSAT preperation classes, and have done so since I was a law student at UC Berkeley. I appreciate the marriage of language and logic. It is a surprisingly good foundation for the kinds of thinking coding requires. 

I don't have a favorite color, although I dress in black, white, and gray. It makes everything go together.

When I was a kid, 12 was my favorite number. I think that's kind of funny for some reason. Ask a 2nd grader what his/her favorite number is and they say 12. So weird.
