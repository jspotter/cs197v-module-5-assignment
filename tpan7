Hi! This is Taiyi! I love traveling and eating delicious food! 
My favorite is Japanese and Chinese food.
For Japanese food, I'd like a whole boat of fresh hamachi sashimi on a bed of daikon, with seaweed and wasabi.  
FOr Chinese food, I'd like an aroumatic boiling pot of Sichuan hotpot with lots of meats, seafood, and veggie in it. 
Cheers!
